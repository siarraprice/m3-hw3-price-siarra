I wouldn't say I had issues with this homework - it's more of a work in progress for me to transition from regular CSS styling to incorporating Bootstrap and Less. As I got was working through it, it continued to make more sense to me as I went through. The one thing I don't know if I did correctly was the floating of the images in each section. The button doesn't float correctly when you move down into tablet and mobile phone views. But it does look great otherwise - and it is responsive regardless.

I did use some outside resources for this assignment. They were the Bootstrap and LESS coding pages.
